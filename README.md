# 3DS FTP Client

`This is my unemployed project! Please hire me if this looks good.`

While trying to move homebrew from one of my 3DS systems to another, I found that there's no FTP client for the 3DS, just the common FTPD server application.

I found this annoying, so I decided to write an FTP client myself. I have experience with networked 3DS development through my 3ds gemini client, so hey why not?
